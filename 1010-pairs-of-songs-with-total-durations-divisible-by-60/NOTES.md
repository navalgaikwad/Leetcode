Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the code's execution:
​
Initialization:
​
count = 0
map = {} (empty HashMap)
Iteration through the time array:
​
For each element t in the time array:
1st element (t = 30):
remainder = 30 % 60 = 30
complement = (60 - 30) % 60 = 30
map = {30: 1}
2nd element (t = 20):
remainder = 20 % 60 = 20
complement = (60 - 20) % 60 = 40
No complement found in the map.
map = {30: 1, 20: 1}
3rd element (t = 150):
remainder = 150 % 60 = 30
complement = (60 - 30) % 60 = 30
Complement found in the map for remainder = 30.
Increment count by the value associated with the complement in the map (i.e., 1).
count = 1
map = {30: 2, 20: 1}
4th element (t = 100):
remainder = 100 % 60 = 40
complement = (60 - 40) % 60 = 20
Complement found in the map for remainder = 40.
Increment count by the value associated with the complement in the map (i.e., 1).
count = 2
map = {30: 2, 20: 1, 40: 1}
5th element (t = 40):
remainder = 40 % 60 = 40
complement = (60 - 40) % 60 = 20
Complement found in the map for remainder = 40.
Increment count by the value associated with the complement in the map (i.e., 1).
count = 3
map = {30: 2, 20: 1, 40: 2}
Final Result:
​
count = 3
The final count of pairs whose sum is divisible by 60 in the provided time array is 3.
