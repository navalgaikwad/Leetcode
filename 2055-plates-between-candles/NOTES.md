Handling Cases with No Candles: In your leftCandels and rightCandels arrays, you are using 0 as the default value. This can be problematic because 0 is a valid index. If there is no candle to the left (or right) of a given index, your current setup will incorrectly consider index 0 as the nearest candle. To fix this, you should initialize index to -1 for both leftCandels and rightCandels arrays and handle these -1 values appropriately in your query processing logic.
​
Incorrect Calculation of Result: The calculation of the number of plates between candles should consider the exclusive nature of the boundaries. That is, the plates counted should be between the candles, not including the candles themselves. Therefore, you need to adjust the calculation to exclude the plates at the positions of the left and right candles.
​
```
class Solution {
public int[] platesBetweenCandles(String s, int[][] queries) {
int len = s.length() ;
int[] plates = new int[len];
int[] leftCandels = new int[len];
int[] rightCandels = new int[len];
//plates[i]
int count =0;
for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
if (s.charAt(i) == '*') {
count++;
}
plates[i] = count;
}
//calculate candels from left
int index = -1; //intialise it -1 not 0 because 0 is valid index
for(int i= len - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
if(s.charAt(i) == ('|')) {
index = i;
}
leftCandels[i] = index;
}
// //calculate candels from right
index = -1;
for(int i=0; i < len; i++) {
if(s.charAt(i) == ('|')) {
index = i;
}
rightCandels[i] = index;
}
//then find the left index and right index and leftIndex < rightIndex
int[] result = new int[queries.length];
int k = 0;
for(int[] query:queries) {
int value1 = query[0];
int value2 = query[1];
int leftIndex = leftCandels[value1];
int rightIndex = rightCandels[value2];
if(leftIndex != -1 && rightIndex != -1 && leftIndex < rightIndex) {
result[k++] = Math.abs(plates[rightIndex] - plates[leftIndex]);
}else {
result[k++] = 0;
}
